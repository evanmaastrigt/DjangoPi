DjangoPi Basic Installer
=
A one-click Django installer for Raspberry pi.

----------

Install Django, Virtualenv and other Django-essentials on your Raspberry Pi.


Usage
=

To start make sure you have:

* Started up your raspberry pi
* Logged in
* Downloaded this package
* Gone to this package folder, this can be done via:


```bash
cd ~/path/to/package
```

Where path/to/package is replaced by the path. If you are unsure: ask for help or use the tab key to show a list of options.

 - Type:

```Python
sudo chmod +x djangopi.sh
```

to make the file executable

- This installer only takes one line of code to set up:

```Python
./djangopi.sh
```

NOTE: this will take a long time if you're running it on a clean install, so go grab a cup of tea!

Adding your other packages
=

You can add your own packages to the installation by typing the package name at the bottom of the requirements.txt and running djangopi again.
